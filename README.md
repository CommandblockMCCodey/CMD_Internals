  **"CMD_INTERNALS"**

this is jus a simpel tool to manage things on windows PCs or Laptops
it can do things like run a command more than once, or set vars faster
you also have to use *CLOSE* to remove all variabels and close the script
to fidout witch commands you can use do *HELP*

windows compiled editione:
it s not released jet but im working on it, it got a preRelease now. you just 
need visual studios to use it right now, but later i want to have a fully working
programm but i dont realy dont know how to fix the problem with a error
with the errorcode 0xc000007c if you have an idea plz write it to me
on the compiled windows edition (The better one) and the good thing is
if you close it like a normal programm it doesnt leavs variabels.
it gets other features ither but im not finish jet

you need to write *HELP* in upper letters because otherways it wont work,
i also made a list of all comands

i hope sombody will like it **:-)**
