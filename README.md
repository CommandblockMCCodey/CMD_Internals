  **"CMD_INTERNALS"**

this is jus a simpel tool to manage things on windows PCs or Laptops
it can do things like run a command more than once, or set vars faster
you also have to use *CLOSE* to remove all variabels and close the script
to fidout witch commands you can use do *HELP*

windows compiled editione:
it s not released jet but im working on it,
on the compiled windows edition (The better one) and the good thing is
if you close it like a normal programm it doesnt leavs variabels.
it gets other features ither but im not finish jet

you need to write *HELP* in upper letters because otherways it wont work,
i also made a list of all comands

i hope sombody will like it **:-)**
