  **"CMD_INTERNALS"**

this is jus a simpel tool to manage things on windows PCs or Laptops
it can do things like run a command more than once, or set vars faster
you also have to use *CLOSE* to remove all variabels and close the script
to fidout witch commands you can use do *HELP*
on the compiled windows edition (The better one) you can also use *CLOSE*
but if you close it like a normal programm it doesnt leavs variabels

i hope sombody will like it **:-)**
